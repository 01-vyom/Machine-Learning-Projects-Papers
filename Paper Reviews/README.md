1) [Schema Based Dialogue System](./Schema%20Based%20Dialgoue%20System) - Covers paper review for [Schema-Guided Paradigm for Zero-Shot Dialog](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07056).

2) [Sign Language Recognition](./Sign%20Language%20Recognition) - Covers paper review for Sign Language Recognition using Deep Learning. Particularly, it covers the broad overview of the Sign Language Recognition, indept analysis for continous and isolated American Sign Language Recognition, implementation of [I3D model](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Li_Word-level_Deep_Sign_Language_Recognition_from_Video_A_New_Large-scale_WACV_2020_paper.html), and some future work for improving continous American Sign Language Recognition.
